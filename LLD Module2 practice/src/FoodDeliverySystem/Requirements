REQUIREMENTS I THOUGHT FOR FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM
1. order placing (adding and selecting address, payment method)
2. adding food to cart
3. filtering food by veg and non veg and vegan
4. filtering food via break fast, lunch, dinner tags
5. search for a dish
6. search for a restaurant
7. history of orders

REQUIREMENTS MENTIONED IN THE CLASS WAS VERY SIMILAR BUT REFER TO CLASS FOR ORIGINAL DOC

DESIGNING HIGH LEVEL APIS( While designing the high level apis think of their input and output as well )
1. foodItemSearcherApi ( foodItemName, foodItemFilters ) should return a List<FoodItem>
2. restaurantSearcherApi ( restaurant name, foodItemFilters ) should return a list of restaurant
3. GetRestaurantById fetches the restaurant and its menu by its id
4. GetFoodItemById fetches the food item by id
5. Add to cart api ( user token, food item id ) and return void
6. place order api (token, payment type, and payment details ) and should return the Order object
7. update order api (  different types of token and their update status , update status should be done based on authentication) should return void
